## Features

### Resume Scoring
Rates each resume against the job description out of 10, chooses which resume is the best-fitting resume, brief explanation why it was chosen, and provide suggestions for improvement.

### Resume Tailoring
Refines the winning resume based on the scoring suggestions without fabricating skills or experiences you do not have. Includes a feedback loop: review the output, approve it, or describe what you would like changed and the AI will revise it.

### Cover Letter Generation
Uses your cover letter template to produce a tailored cover letter aligned with the job description and your tailored resume. If no template is provided, the AI writes one from scratch.

### Interview Prep Guide
Generates a study guide based on the job description, including key topics to study, practice interview questions, and interview tips.

## Limitations
- **Resume formatting** - the tailored resume is exported as plain text inside a `.docx` file. You will need to apply your own formatting and layout before submitting.
- **Manual job description input** - the job description must be copy-pasted into `job_description.txt` manually. Support for direct job posting URLs is planned for a future version.

- **Batch processing** — run multiple job descriptions in a single session
- **Company research** — use web search to find company culture, recent news, and role-specific insights to strengthen cover letters and interview prep
- **Better resume formatting** — structured `.docx` output that preserves the original resume layout
- **Job URL support** — paste a job posting URL instead of manually copying the description
- **Match score threshold** — warn the user if the match score is too low before proceeding
